Summary: The project focuses on developing a Game Center that offers 4 different games: Tic Tac Toe, Connect Four, Hangman, and an additional game. The implementation of the games utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as some UI components from [flowbite](https://flowbite.com/#components).

## 1) Project description

The Game Center is a website that offers users a collection of classic games for an enjoyable gaming experience. The website features three games: Tic Tac Toe, Hangman, and Connect Four, with a focus on local multiplayer gameplay.

The home page of the Game Center serves as the central hub, providing links to each game. Users can easily navigate to the specific game they want to play.

The Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to compete against each other locally using the same input device. The game follows standard rules, with players taking turns marking their chosen symbol on a 3x3 grid. The game ends when one player achieves a winning combination or if it results in a draw.

Hangman is a single-player game that tests users' vocabulary skills. Players are presented with a hidden word or phrase, and they must guess individual letters to uncover the secret word. The players only have a certain amount of guesses until they loose the game. The player wins by successfully guessing the word before the hangman is complete.

For those looking for a competitive two-player game, Connect Four is available. Players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertically suspended grid. The goal is to be the first to connect four discs of the same color either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
