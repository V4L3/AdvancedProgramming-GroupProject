# Group Project: Game Center

This repository contains a group project for the course "Skills: Programming with Advanced Computer Languages". The project focuses on developing a Game Center that offers 4 different games: Tic Tac Toe, Connect Four, Hangman, and an additional game. The implementation of the games utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Games

- Tic Tac Toe: A classic paper-and-pencil game where players aim to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
- Connect Four: A strategic game where players aim to connect four of their colored discs in a row, column, or diagonal.
- Hangman: A word-guessing game where players attempt to identify an unknown word by guessing individual letters.
- Additional Game: A customizable or user-defined game that can be added to the Game Center.
